# WeatherMCP
This is a simple MCP that retrieves the weather for your AI tool.

## How to build it
I built this on Python 3.12.

* Clone the repo
* Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
* Start the virtual environment: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
* Install the dependency packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the server: `python weather.py`
